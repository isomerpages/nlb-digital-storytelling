### **What is the National Digital Storytelling Competition?**
Launched in 2018 as a collaboration with Microsoft Singapore, the National Digital Storytelling Competition (NDSC) is an annual school tournament in which students are invited to conceptualise and create interactive multimedia stories using software such as Paint 3D and PowerPoint. Top teams stand a chance to win attractive prizes and their stories will be used by NLB librarians during actual storytelling sessions held at the Stories Come Alive Room in library@harboutfront. 

Now in its third year, NDSC 2020 is targeted at students from secondary schools and post-secondary institutions (ITE colleges, polytechnics and junior colleges) in Singapore. We welcome students from Special Education (SPED) schools to join in the fun as well. If you are eligible, here’s your chance to get creative! 

Starting from **3 March 2020**, register a team of up to three members and submit your story proposals. Shortlisted teams will be invited to attend training sessions and rehearsals and eventually showcase their work at the semi-finals to be held in the Stories Come Alive Room, library@harbourfront. The top six teams that are selected to progress to the final round stand a chance to win attractive prizes and their stories will be used by our librarians during actual multimedia storytelling sessions.
